The `docext` Package
====================

The `docext` package is an extension for documenting LaTeX source files.

It provides
- An elegant way to typeset the `key-value` list.
- The `codedemo` enviornment for typesetting the code within a `verbatim` and a
`demo` environment at the same time.

It fixes the errors of the `doc` package under
- The engines: `pTeX` and `upTeX`.
- The classes: `book` and `report` (or any class uses the `titlepage`
environment in `\maketitle`)

This package is based on the `doc` package and works smoothly under the `l3doc`,
`ltxdoc`, and `article` classes.
